# AWOL
Absent without leave...

This is fun little mobile gaming app designed to be a survival game at its core.

The idea is to create a 2D battery efficient, offline/bluetooth/online, community driven game *WITHOUT* any paid dlc or microtransactions or ads or bs of any kind.

At the moment the game is still under development although an alpha is out for Android (see releases, download at your own discretion).
